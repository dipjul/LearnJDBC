# Learn Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)

## Introduction
### What is JDBC?
The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API provides universal data access from the Java programming language. Using the JDBC API, you can access virtually any data source, from relational databases to spreadsheets and flat files. JDBC technology also provides a common base on which tools and alternate interfaces can be built.

The JDBC API is comprised of two packages:
- java.sql
- javax.sql

You automatically get both packages when you download the Java Platform Standard Edition (Java SE) 8.

To use the JDBC API with a particular database management system, you need a JDBC technology-based driver to mediate between JDBC technology and the database. Depending on various factors, a driver might be written purely in the Java programming language or in a mixture of the Java programming language and Java Native Interface (JNI) native methods.
